### Stage 4: Objection Handling (Ongoing)

#### Common Objections & Responses

**"It's too expensive"**
> "I understand price is important. Let's look at the ROI. Our average client sees payback in 4 months and 300% ROI in year one. For your business, that could mean $[X] in savings. Can you afford NOT to do this?"

**"We need to think about it"**
> "Of course, this is an important decision. What specifically would you like to think through? Often clients want to understand [implementation/ROI/timeline]. Which concerns you most?"

**"We're looking at other solutions"**
> "That's smart due diligence. How do the other solutions compare in terms of [depth of analysis/time to value/ROI guarantee]? What criteria are most important in your decision?"

**"We don't have time for this now"**
> "I appreciate you're busy. That's exactly why our solution works - it requires just 2 hours of your time total. Meanwhile, your competitors are already automating. When would be a better time to save $[X] per year?"

**"How do we know the AI is accurate?"**
> "Great question. Our AI is trained on thousands of successful implementations and validated by industry experts. Plus, you get consultation hours to review and refine recommendations. We also offer a satisfaction guarantee."

### Stage 5: Negotiation & Closing (Days 11-14)

#### Closing Techniques

**1. Assumptive Close**
"Based on our discussion, the Enterprise package makes most sense for your needs. Should we start with the full assessment next Monday, or would Wednesday work better?"

**2. Urgency Close**
"We have a promotion this month where you get an additional 4 consultation hours free - a $2,000 value. This ends Friday. Should we get you started?"

**3. ROI Close**
"You mentioned saving $50K/month is your target. Our analysis shows potential savings of $75K/month. That's $300K in the first four months alone. Shall we proceed?"

**4. Trial Close**
"If we could guarantee you'd identify at least $500K in annual savings, would you be ready to move forward today?"

#### Negotiation Framework
- **Never discount more than 20%** without manager approval
- **Trade concessions** for commitments (case study, referral, longer contract)
- **Add value instead of discounting** (extra consultations, additional reports)
- **Create urgency** with limited-time bonuses

### Stage 6: Expansion & Retention (Ongoing)

1. **Quarterly Reviews**: $7,500/year
2. **Additional Departments**: New assessment per division
